### Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile ready 
#### (*only the Android app is being developed as I am just starting to learn Swift*)

An app which uses Plaid's APIs and allows users to track the balances and transactions for any financial institution they choose to link.

*This is a work in progress and for now, only the Android app is being developed as I am just starting to learn Swift.*

The [backend](https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server) is using Plaid's sandbox API, so you can only
get fake data.

## Usage

### Install

````shell script
./gradlew installSandboxDebug
````

Register with any email address you'd like, the format needs to be valid but nothing will be emailed
to you.

#### *You can also grab the latest signed APK from the releases tab.*

### Linking financial institutions

When linking a financial institution use the sandbox credentials below. If prompted for an MFA
method, choose any of them and enter 1234 for the code. Bank of America does prompt for MFA so take
note when linking.

```
username: custom_user1 or custom_user2
password: any non-empty string
pin: credential_good (when required)
MFA code: 1234 (when required)
```

*With some institutions, Chase being one, the above credentials will not work, use the following:*

```
username: user_good
password: pass_good
```

Please see [Plaid sandbox test credentials](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/test-credentials/) for
MFA credentials if the institution you are attempting to link requires them.

### Using a local server

* Clone or fork the backend
  from [https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server](https://github.com/ruffCode/yaba-server)
* Enable staging build type by uncommenting "localServerUrl" in `gradle.properties` and insert the
  url of your local instance
* If using an insecure host, change the domain value
  in `staging/res/xms/network-security-config.xml`
* Install ```./gradlew installSandboxStaging ```

## Prior Art

### [tivi by Chris Banes](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi)

This project is a great example of how to build a large and stable project. I was greatly inspired
by Chris' state management technique and do use some of his code, including Flow extensions,
observers and interactors. Credit is given where used.

### [KaMPKit by Touchlab](https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit)

Great starter template for KMM. I used the Koin setup logic as well as some Koin extensions.

### [ComposeCookbook by Gurupreet Singh](https://github.com/Gurupreet/ComposeCookBook)

Thanks for the pie chart!
